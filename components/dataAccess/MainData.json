            "description": "Over 8 weeks this summer, I worked on an independent research project in the Gurkar Lab at the Aging Institute. This was my first experience of research, and so having Dr Gurkar as my supervisor made all the difference in the world. She led me through the stages of planning out my project, data collection, and even data analysis, and the skills and knowledge which I gained from my time at the lab have been absolutely invaluable back at university in Oxford. Dr Gurkar and the whole team at the Gurkar lab are all lovely people and were very enthusiastic in welcoming me to Pittsburgh and to their lab. They were all very happy to help me with the details of my lab work and the different assays which I carried out, and I am really happy that I had the chance to know everyone there over my summer! Working at the Aging Institute, I had the opportunity to listen to fascinating talks from experts in the field of aging, on subjects such as novel senolytic drugs and telomere biology. However, my most memorable experiences of the summer included the time our lab spent together, including our lab picnic in Oakland at the end of summer, weekly lab meetings and journal club (always sure to feature a sweet treat!), and the lab potluck we had right before I left. I would thoroughly recommend the Gurkar lab to any students who would like to gain research experience in a fun and welcoming environment."
